# calculator
In this project I will demonstrate more of what I have learned in the Odin Project Curriculum, specifically all the thing I have demosntrated in my earlier projects and more for example javascript array methods, working with arrays as well as objects, changing DOM, changing DOM nodes attributes in javascript, loops 
1. create basic functions add for addition multiply for multiplication and so on
2. user will input 2 numbers first number and then second number after an operator
3. create a function that populates the display, when user clicks on button it outputs on display, store user inputs in array, output array on display through text content property
4. if user pushes CE set operator to empty, first number to empty array and second number to empty array 
5. if user tries to input by 0 output a random message that they can`t divide by zero, set secondNumber to [] so they have to input it again, create it in a function inifnity check and add it to every operator
